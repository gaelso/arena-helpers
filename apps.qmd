### Support sampling designs and implementation

-   **oNFI: Optimize national forest inventory design**

    Provides indicative optimal sample size and plot design for forest inventories based on biomass maps or variance models and a minimalist series of action timers (driving to plot, measuring trees, etc.).

    -   Online version: [link](URL)

    -   Local installation (R console): `devtools::instal_github("openforis/oNFI")`

-   **Bootstrap NFI sampling size (package name TBD)**

    Lauri's app currently on openforis shinyapps.io

-   **NFI implementation dashboard (package name TBD)**

    Simple app showing plot location and data collection status for tracking progress and management purposes.

### Support calculations from raw data

-   **SPvalid: Species names validation tool**

-   **Height-diameter models**

-   **MCredd: Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation for REDD+**
